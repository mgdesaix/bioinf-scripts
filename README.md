# bioinf-scripts

This is a collection of bioinformatics and population genomics scripts for whole-genome sequence data, which includes working with both low-coverage data/probabilistic genotypes in [ANGSD](http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD) and moderate coverage/SNP calling in [GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us). Most scripts are optimized for running large job arrays via HPC.

Actively being updated.
